# Lets put a smile on that face

## What's in the effect?
The effect contains a Joker mask that you can wear on screen and record yourself. But there isn't only one style, there are four!

1. **The Dark Knight(2008)** - Heath Ledger
2. **Joker(2019)** - Joaquin Phoenix
3. **Batman(1989)** - Jack Nicholson
4. **Suicide Squad(2016)** - Jared Leto

## What's more?
You can **tap on the screen** to add a text that moves along with your head, that is iconic of the character whose mask you chose to wear. This is especially good for taking a photo and posting.

You can also record a very good performance video (unlike ours) that has your **voice deepened** to quite imitate how that specific Joker would speak (not exactly though).

We also added custom instructions to notify the user that all this is possible!
